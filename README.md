# Lily58 3D

3D printable plate and base for the Lily58 Pro.

## Hardware

You'll need the models printed, plus these parts per side:

- 7 × M2 nuts
- 7 × 8mm M2 bolts
  - Button/pan head bolts work well. A whole set of M2 bolts of different lengths is pretty affordable
  - Please check the 3D models again before buying specific lengths, I am unsure if this is the right lengths
