# Lily58 3D

3D printable plate and base for the Lily58 Pro.

Goals:

- Portable, not take up too much space in my bag
- Low profile while using full-size switches

## Hardware

You'll need the models printed, plus these parts per side:

- 7 × M2 nuts
- 7 × 8mm M2 bolts
  - Button/pan head bolts work well. A whole set of M2 bolts of different lengths is pretty affordable
  - Please check the 3D models again before buying specific lengths, I am unsure if this is the right lengths

## Media

I did a [talk on this at Hackware v7.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgcLRntWxqA).
