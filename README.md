## Hardware

You'll need the models printed, plus these parts per side:

- 7 &mul; M2 nuts
- 7 &mul; 8mm M2 bolts
  - Button/pan head bolts work well. A whole set of M2 bolts of different lengths is pretty affordable
  - Please check the 3D models again before buying specific lengths, I am unsure if this is the right lengths
